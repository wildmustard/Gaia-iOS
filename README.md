# Gaia-iOS
__CodePath Group Project__
Authored By: R. Alex Clark, John Henning, Carlos Avogadro

## Project Description
Gaia is an iOS application that acts as a catalogue of wildlife. Using the custom image classification API using a convolutional neural network, the user is able to document any wildlife encountered using simply the iPhone camera. Gaia will enable users to compete with their friends for the largest collection of documented wildlife. The collected images of the encountered wildlife will provide helpful metrics such as geographic location of encounter, date & time, and lifetime encounters with captured organisms.

## User Stories
* Setup the neural network API to communicate with Gaia and classify images
* Setup the camera capture view enabling user to snap photos of subjects, this acts as the landing view for the application
* Create view for users' catalogue of taken images, this would be accessed from the landing view
* Create view for users' score, this would be a pulldown from the landing view
* Create view for handling the post image capture event, which appears once the user takes an image using the capture button on the landing view


### Optional Features
* Custom API training for the network to better identify the animals
* Crowdsource the tag training for more accurate selection
* Scoreboard for tracking other users
* Create view for geographic tracking of photo locations, displayed on a map view

### API Endpoints Used
* ![The Unofficial Wikipedia API](http://www.programmableweb.com/api/wikipedia)`
