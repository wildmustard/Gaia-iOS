__CodePath Group Project__   
Authored By: R. Alex Clark, John Henning, Carlos Avogadro

## Project Description
Gaia is an iOS application that acts as a catalogue of wildlife. Using the Clarifai API, the user is able to document any wildlife encountered using simply the iPhone camera. Gaia will enable users to compete with their friends for the largest collection of documented wildlife. The collected images of the encountered wildlife will provide helpful metrics such as geographic location of encounter, date & time, and lifetime encounters with captured organisms.
